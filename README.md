# Design Patterns and Principles with Example

### Design Principles
1. Program to Interface not Implementation
2. Favor Composition over Inheritance

### SOLID Design Principles
1. **S**ingle Responsibility : Class should have one and only one reason to change.
2. **O**pen/Close Princile : Class should be open for extension, but close for modification.
3. **L**iskov Subsitution Principle : Let q(x) be a property provable about object x of type T. Then q(y) should be provable about object y of type S. where S is subtype of T.
  Subclass behave in a such way that it will not cause any problem when it use instead of SuperClass.
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle : Client should not be forced to depend upon interface that they don't use.
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle : High level module should not depend on low level module. Both should depend upon abstraction. Abstraction should not depend upon detail, Detail should depend upon abstraction.
